      "The Tirthan River is the lifeline of Tirthan Valley, originating from the glacial springs of Hanskund deep inside the Great Himalayan National Park. The river flows through dense forests, rocky gorges, and traditional Himachali villages before merging with the Beas River at Larji.",
      "The river is famous for its crystal-clear waters, which are home to brown and rainbow trout — making it one of the best trout fishing destinations in the Indian Himalayas. Anglers from across the country visit to try their hand at catch-and-release fishing in these pristine waters.",
      "Beyond fishing, the Tirthan River offers numerous riverside camping spots, opportunities for river crossing adventures, and simply peaceful spots to sit and enjoy the sound of flowing water against a backdrop of towering mountains. Many of the valley's best homestays and cottages are located along its banks.",
